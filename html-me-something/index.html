   <p  id="testP" class="funParagraph"> My coding story started in Ladue Horton Watkins High school. During my senior year I deceided to take a coding class to see if I could learn a thing or two about coding. At the time I was very naive and I thought I could learn how to make a website by taking one class, I learned very soon that learning to code a website was not gonna be very easy.  </p>

         I wanted to drop the coding class almost as soon as the semester started but I did not and I am glad I didn't drop it. I struggled very much to grasp the concepts I was being taught at the time. Even though I was completely new to coding I wanted to understand everything and it used to make me very frustrated when I didn't understand a concept or lesson in class. I ended up passing the class which motivated me to continue my coding career. I continued my coding career by applying for a coding program called launch code. I was accepted into the program and now we are learning coding languages like Javascript and other markup languages like HTML & CSS.

         After luanchcode I want to enter the tech industry and work for a major tech company that pays me a lot of money. The reason I am pursuing a coding career is to earn a better salary and make a better life for me and my family. I hope to inspire other african american youth in my life to pursue coding because I truly believe computers are the future of mankind.
